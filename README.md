This project presents a three-page Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road safety risk across French departments. The goal was not just to visualize numbers, but to structure a clear interpretation of risk by combining accident volume, mortality intensity, and severity patterns within a spatial framework.

The first page provides an executive overview through key indicators such as Total Accidents, Total Deaths, Death Rate, and Average Severity. The second page introduces a dynamic choropleth map of France, allowing the user to switch between accident volume and mortality metrics to understand territorial disparities. The third page focuses on departmental comparison, including a dynamic Top 10 ranking and a combined chart contrasting accident exposure with fatality intensity to distinguish structural risk from localized lethality.

The dataset consists of aggregated accident metrics by department, enriched with geospatial centroids extracted from a French departments GeoJSON file using Python. DAX measures were used extensively to build dynamic calculations and structured comparisons.

A full demonstration video of the dashboard is available in the project folder, and the original Power BI (.pbix) file has also been included for deeper inspection of the data model, relationships, and measures.

This project aims to provide a structured, data-driven perspective on public safety risk distribution across France.
